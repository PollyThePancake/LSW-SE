# LSW-SE

The LSW-SE (LEGO Star Wars Save Editor) is a tool used for modifying save files for LEGO Star Wars games and fixing the checksum so that they bypass the games corruption checks

## What can I use it on?

At the moment, there is only support for the following formats

### LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga
- PC

## How to use?

Download and run the .exe found in the [Releases](https://github.com/QueenPolly/LSW-SE/releases) tab. Then click the Open button and select a save file. The editor will automatically create a backup of the selected file.

From there you can change how many studs you have, or set which characters are locked and unlocked. You can also open a chars.txt file so that you know what characters your locking and unlocking.

## Finding your save files?

Save files should be located at "%LOCALAPPDATA%\LucasArts\LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga\SavedGames"

## License

LSW-SE is licensed under MIT and is free for everyone to use. I only ask that you credit the use of this tool and do not claim it as your own work
